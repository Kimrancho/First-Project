    In the five years before the release of Ryzen, AMD's direct competitor in the
    x86 and x86-64 consumer-level CPU marketspace,
  <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel">
    Intel
  </a></strong>,
    had continued to grow its market share with the tick-tock improvement cycle
    of its <strong>Core series of microprocessors</strong>. Since the release of
    its Bulldozer microarchitecture in 2011, AMD's CPUs had fallen progressively
    behind those from Intel in both single-and multi-core performance.
    Despite a die shrink and several revisions of the Bulldozer architecture,
    performance and power efficiency failed to catch up with Intel's competing
    products.

  <p style="margin-top:30px;">
    Ryzen is the consumer-level implementation of the newer Zen microarchitecture,
    a complete re-design that marked the return of AMD to the high-end CPU market,
    offering a product stack able to compete with Intel at every level. Having
    more processing cores, Ryzen processors offer
  <span style="color:green"> greater multi-threaded </span>
    performance at the same price point relative to Intel's Core processors.
    The Zen architecture delivers more than <strong> 52% improvement in
    instructions-per-clock cycle </strong> over the previous-generation
    Bulldozer AMD core, without increasing power consumption. Since the release
    of Ryzen, AMD's CPU market share has increased while Intel appears to have
    stagnated.
